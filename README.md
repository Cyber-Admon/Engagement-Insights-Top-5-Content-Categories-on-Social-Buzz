## Engagement-Insights-Top-5-Content-Categories-on-Social-Buzz

### Overview
The **Social Buzz Analysis** project was launched to explore and analyze user-generated content on the **Social Buzz** platform. Social Buzz is a rapidly growing social media platform with over 500 million active users, offering an anonymous space for users to engage with a variety of content. The purpose of this analysis is to identify and understand the platformâ€™s top-performing content categories, providing insights for refining content strategy and preparing for the company's upcoming IPO.

### Project Objective
- **Problem:** With over **100,000 posts per day** (approximately **36.5 million pieces of content per year**), Social Buzz faces the challenge of managing and leveraging this large volume of unstructured data.
- **Objective:** The main goal of this project was to audit Social Buzz's data practices using spreadsheets, analyze the most popular content categories, and provide guidance for the IPO. The findings aim to enhance content strategies and boost user engagement.

### Key Insights
The analysis focused on identifying the top five content categories based on user engagement metrics. The key insights include:
- **Most Popular Category:** The "Studying" category emerged as the top-performing content type, receiving **49,442** reactions.
- **Other High-Performing Categories:**
  - "Dogs" followed closely with **48,398** reactions.
  - Categories like **Tennis**, **Veganism**, and **Public Speaking** also performed well, with engagement ranging from **45,751** to **46,185** reactions.
- **Engagement Trends:** Content related to education (e.g., studying) and pets (e.g., dogs) significantly drives user engagement, while lifestyle and hobby topics also attract consistent interest.

### Process and Workflow
The analysis was conducted through a structured five-step process using spreadsheets:
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Defining key objectives, challenges, and the data needed for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis by addressing unstructured and incomplete entries.
3. **Data Modelling**: Utilizing spreadsheet functions and formulas to uncover patterns in the content categories.
4. **Uncover Insights**: Analyzing the data to identify trends and user preferences.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of insights to aid in understanding and decision-making.

### Team
The project was carried out by the analytics team at Social Buzz, including:
- **Andrew Fleming**: Chief Technology Architect
- **Marcus Rompton**: Senior Principal
- **Abdulmalik A. O.**: Data Analyst

### Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, it is recommended that Social Buzz concentrate its content strategy on categories that generate the most engagement, particularly educational and pet-related content. This focus will help maintain and potentially increase the active user base while preparing for future growth, including the IPO.

### Next Steps
- Refine content strategies to highlight **educational** and **pet-related** content.
- Sustain and further develop engagement in **lifestyle** and **hobby** categories.
- Continuously monitor content trends to adapt strategies as user interests evolve.
